# Interactive Event Page - Example

In this advanced HTML project, we’re going to test ourselves by mixing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an external API to create an event page for a tech conference.

Yep, we’re going to be using the Google Maps API to create an interactive map for users to see where our conference is located. Pretty cool, I know!

So, while you might have thought, huh, this is a basic task, an event or conference page is actually a really engaging HTML project as it combines various real-world web dev skills.

In particular, integrating with an external API like Google Maps is great practice for real-world projects, as this is the type of thing you’d need to do all the time.

And yes, I know we’re using JavaScript again in this project, but trust me, you need to learn JavaScript to be a pro web developer with HTML.

We’ll also be using Bootstrap again here to create a responsive design, as this is often essential for event attendees who want to access information on different device types.

So, get ready to use the following skills in this HTML project:

- HTML5: Use semantic elements to structure the webpage.
- CSS3 & Bootstrap: Use Bootstrap's grid system and components to create a pro layout.
- Google Maps API: Integrate Google Maps to display the event location.
- JavaScript: Create an interactive Google Map in an external JS file.
- Form Handling: Create a registration form to allow users to sign up for the event.

Just like before, we’ll only be using a very small amount of simple JavaScript in this project.

Also, super important but remember to replace the API Key placeholder text with your own Google Maps API key in the script tag for the Google Maps API call.

If you’re new to this, you need to do the following:

- Setup a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account
- Create a new project
- Enable Billing on your project
- Enable the Google Maps Platform APIs
- Create an API Key

It’s all fairly standard stuff for working with GCP, but if you are still learning web development or you haven’t worked in the cloud before, it could be new to you.

Then again, I’m hoping that you’ll be excited to take on new challenges like this, as it’s a great way to add real-world, marketable web development skills to your portfolio! 

Let’s now take a look at the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code for this cool project.

You’ll notice that our CSS file is not as short as the last time we used BootStrap, but that’s just because we wanted to override some of the default styles.

As always, please experiment with this code! There’s so much you can do here, whether that’s altering the navbar, altering the section layout, or playing with the CSS styling.

Also, have a play with the GPS coordinates in the JS file to see how the map changes.
